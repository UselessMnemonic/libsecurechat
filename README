Welcome to LibSecureChat!

This is a project library meant to provide a simple interface for implementing
a secure chat service for your application.

The library will consist of a server class and a client class.
Each will expose an interface for interacting with server rooms, clients, and
rich content messages programmatically.

Each server hosts a single room, and sets up several parameters to the author's
preference.

The API follows a RESTful specification. It describes the interface available to
the author for both ends of the service. This API is described in the provided
wiki page. A javadoc is also provided.
